# CPP

This project contains the exercises of Module 00 to Module 09 of C++.
Through the development of this project, I discovered the intricacies of the C++ language, uncovering its power and flexibility. Coding this project exposed me to a comprehensive understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. As I implemented various functionalities, I gained practical insights into Data Structures, Classes and objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism (function overloading, operator overloading), Abstraction, Memory Management, Exception Handling, File I/O, Standard Template Library (STL) and Templates, making this project a valuable journey into the heart of C++ and OOP principles.
